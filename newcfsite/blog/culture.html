                                                    We have happy customers and happy partners. We
                                                    do unique work. We have a unique, patented

                                                    and partners tell us that they love our folks as human

                                                    Being a good person isn’t about beliefs.
                                                    Different people believe different things, and that is
                                                    wonderful. Different people have different
                                                    backgrounds, and that is wonderful. Different
                                                    people look and behave differently, and that is
                                                    wonderful. People are different. We love
                                                    that. We encourage that. Diverse
                                                    viewpoints enable better outcomes. We recognize
                                                    that every human being is unique, and we want each
                                                    person to embrace that. Be yourself. Be
                                                    your truest self. Talk about your experiences
                                                    and beliefs. Do not force your views on one
                                                    another, but be free to be yourself.

                                                    about other people. We want people who can give
                                                    examples of where they’ve volunteered at some point in
                                                    their life to help someone or something other than
                                                    themselves. We are looking for people who will
                                                    not “step on heads to get ahead”. We want people
                                                    who will serve customers and serve teammates and
                                                    really mean it. We want people who love everyone

                                                    We want people who <i>keep their word</i>. We
                                                    want people who see their word as their bond. We
                                                    want folks who will do whatever it takes to make sure

                                                    customer.We want folks to will do everything in
                                                    their power to help their teammates.
                                                  </p>

                                                  <p>
                                                    We want people who are <i>loyal</i>. We want
                                                    everyone that works here to retire here.
                                                    Obviously, that isn’t realistic, but that’s our
                                                    goal. If you’ve bounced around chasing money or
                                                    titles, CloudFit is not the place for you. At
                                                    the same time, I don’t think we’ve hired anyone who
                                                    came in making less than they made before. Both
                                                    things can be true—make money and be loyal. Most
                                                    people have the order flipped. We prioritize
                                                    loyalty. And note, we also recognize that the
                                                    company is an inanimate thing that is made up of
                                                    animate people. People aren’t typically loyal to
                                                    paper. Loyalty is earned, and once earned,

                                                  <p>
                                                    One of the keys to earning trust is consistency.
                                                    A mentor once asked me “if you shake up a soda, what
                                                    comes out?” I answered “foam / fizz”. My
                                                    mentor said, “No, it is still soda—if you shake it up,
                                                    what is on the inside comes out. The same is
                                                    true with people. When you shake them up /
                                                    during tough times, what is inside of them comes
                                                    out.” We have to be consistent in our messaging
                                                    and behaviors internally, and we have to be consistent
                                                    in our messaging and behaviors externally. If we
                                                    quote a price, that is the price. If the price
                                                    doesn’t meet the customer’s budget, the scope must
                                                    change in order to reduce the price. If the
                                                    customer has an outage on a holiday, and the root
                                                    cause is due to the actions of another systems

                                                    bitterness—to get the customer’s critical systems back
                                                    online. That sort of response must be on-point,
                                                    and it must be consistent. It takes a lifetime
                                                    to build a reputation, and it only takes a single
                                                    “moment of truth” to ruin it—that is true for people
                                                    and for companies.

                                                  <h4>4. Doing The Right Thing</h4>

                                                  <p>
                                                    At the end of the day, “doing the right thing” has to
                                                    be the most important thing. We have to reward
                                                    the right behaviors. We have to swiftly discuss the
                                                    wrong behaviors. If the wrong behaviors persist,
                                                    we have to take action. But the best answer is
                                                    to hire the right people in the first place, and we
                                                    have been very blessed on that front. Every
                                                    meeting, every one-on-one, every discussion must be
                                                    bathed in discussions about finding the right answer
                                                    and then doing that. We often say “stop trying
                                                    to be right and find the right answer”. Human
                                                    nature is to argue to “be right”. There also has
                                                    to be the recognition that what one person sees as the
                                                    “right thing” may be different than what someone else
                                                    sees as the “right thing”, and in those cases, we have
                                                    to talk through it to find the
                                                    best-right-answer. At CloudFit, we try to force
                                                    discussions about finding the right answer.
                                                    Hierarchy does not matter. We all have to be
                                                    humble enough to 1) care more about the right answer
                                                    than being right 2) help our teammates and customers
                                                    3) take help when it is given and 4) ask for help when
                                                    it is needed.

                                                  <p>
                                                    One of the definitions of family as defined by
                                                    Merriam-Webster is the following: “a group of
                                                    individuals living under one roof and usually under
                                                    one head”. In our case, the “head” are the
                                                    mission, vision and SERVE values. The “roof” is
                                                    virtual; the “roof” is CloudFit Software (the
                                                    company). In families, people aren’t always
                                                    biological relatives. In families, people don’t
                                                    always share the same beliefs/look the same/act the
                                                    same/etc. In families, there is a bond. In
                                                    families, there is love. In families, there is
                                                    trust. In families, there is responsibility and
                                                    accountability to one another and to the family.
                                                    In families, all of those characteristics mean that
                                                    people are “real” with one another. There is a
                                                    freedom in that realness—even tough conversations have
                                                    to be had because of the responsibility and
                                                    accountability for the family and to each member
                                                    therein. At CloudFit, we try hard to be a
                                                    family. At CloudFit, we try hard to love like
                                                    family. And like a typical family, we aren’t
                                                    perfect. But, in spite of imperfection, the
                                                    importance of the family sustains the bond.
                                                    Ultimately, the stakes are too high to not force tough
                                                    conversations. We owe it to our customers. We

                                                      CloudFit who do not love the culture. We
                                                      recognize that there have been folks who have left
                                                      CloudFit for various reasons. We do not claim
                                                      to be perfect, but we do strive to be our best
                                                      version of perfect in-line with the SERVE values and
                                                      the culture ideals that are bulleted above.

                                                    <li>
                                                      We are not trying to “sell” the culture to
                                                      you. We are trying to write it down.
                                                      Writing it down leads to great dialog. If we
                                                      were trying to “sell” it, we’d be pushing the great
                                                      employee and customer quotations to you.
                                                      That’s not our goal. If part of our culture is
                                                      being “real”, a big part of being real is going
                                                      on-record with the “what”. That’s the intent
                                                      here—to write it down so that we can take the next
                                                      step in the dialog together as a family.

                                                    At CloudFit, we want to lead the “Cloud
                                                    Revolution”. John Deere was key in the
                                                    Agricultural Revolution. General Electric was
                                                    key in the Industrial Revolution. CloudFit
                                                    Software will be key in the Cloud Revolution.
                                                    We’ve been blessed beyond compare—you can’t make this
                                                    stuff up. Who wins Microsoft’s Partner Award two
                                                    years in a row? And who wins that award two of
                                                    the three years that the company has existed? We
                                                    are unique. We are thankful. And our
                                                    people are everything. Our customers and
