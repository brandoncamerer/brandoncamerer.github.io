												<h2 class="text-color-dark font-weight-bold text-8 line-height-2 negative-ls-1 pb-1 mb-1">2023 Mental Health Campaign</h2>

												<p>At CloudFit, our people are at the heart of everything we do. Our team is our most valuable asset, which is why we’ve made it our mission to cultivate a workplace culture that prioritizes physical and mental health. One of the ways we demonstrate this commitment is through our annual mental health campaign, where we dedicate an entire month to mental health awareness. This year, we've chosen to focus on mental health awareness, mental illness, and neurodivergence, to uplift our team through a supportive and inclusive work environment.</p>

    <h2>Mental Health Matters</h2>
    <p>We firmly believe that mental health matters just as much as physical health. We've recognized that addressing mental well-being is essential to the overall health and happiness of our CloudFitters. As the stigma surrounding mental health gradually diminishes, we are taking proactive steps to engage our team in meaningful conversations.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>“Awareness and discussion of mental health is crucial in any workplace. As someone who recently went through a lot of personal loss, a good support system at work was essential for me to not just remain functional, but productive as well. CloudFit's mental health campaign this month helped me to be more open and honest about issues I am facing with my mental health,” said Morgan Segner, Service Engineer at CloudFit. “Many others also felt encouraged to speak about their mental health and received plenty of love and encouragement from their peers. I am grateful to work somewhere where mental health issues aren't stigmatized. Where we are encouraged to discuss it and to give and receive the encouragement to find potential solutions to these struggles.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Tim Wolff, Architect Site Reliability Engineer, also expressed the importance of awareness: “Mental health awareness has become one of the most important aspects of my life. It helped me break the stigma I had so I could recognize the things that were most important to me. It helped me redefine who I am, who I want to be, and how to be happy. It is not easy to open up to others, but it is amazingly effective. CloudFit’s mental health campaign is a great reminder that I need a continual focus on maintaining psychological well-being and discussion is one of the best ways to improve and pull things into perspective. There are people out there who want to listen, get to know you, and help you through issues that affect and are personal to you.”</p>

    <p>One of the most important initiatives at CloudFit is our annual mental health campaign. For one month each year, our entire organization comes together to shine a spotlight on mental health. During this time, we encourage everyone to participate in activities and discussions related to mental health. For us, reducing the stigma and creating a space for our team to be their authentic self is necessary. By fostering a culture of openness and acceptance, we empower our team members to be themselves without fear of judgement.</p>

   
        <p>Justin Hensley, Principal Personal Trainer, discussed how our campaign this year impacted his personal and work life:  <blockquote>“As the dad of two sons that are neurodivergent, I was so excited when I heard that CloudFit was focusing on mental health and better awareness of the needs of our neurodivergent colleagues. Our oldest son was diagnosed with autism in 2019, and our second oldest was diagnosed with dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia in 2022. They're both very capable in their own way, but also learn in ways different than the 'normal' way I thought I always knew. The opportunity to learn more about how to interact with my colleagues at CloudFit who may also fit these traits has been eye-opening both at work and at home. I'm so proud that CloudFit sees all people as important and valuable!”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>You Matter</h2>
    <p>“It’s okay to not be okay”, “You are not alone”, “It’s okay to think differently” – three short phrases that can mean the world to someone who is impacted by mental health, mental illness, or neurodivergence. Our goal is to break down barriers and create a workplace where every individual can thrive. Our commitment and support for this goal is endless, the amazing work that our team does to push this forward is admirable.</p>

 
        <p>Kymberlee Stephens’s dedication to employee support and wellness has been felt throughout our entire organization since joining CloudFit. Serving as the Senior Manager of Employee Experience and Wellness, her focus on the value and importance of taking care of others is making a tremendous impact.    <blockquote>“Stigma remains one of the leading reasons people don’t ask for support or seek treatment. The easiest way to reduce stigma is normalizing discussions around mental health, debunking myths, and sharing knowledge & personal experiences with one another. A majority of us spend most of our day at work, that’s why it’s critical to bring these conversations into the workplace,” stated Kymberlee.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In just five years of operation, we’ve built a culture that we’re proud of and will continue to make strides to make CloudFit the best place it can be. We will always put people first, whether it’s our team, partners, or community; that’s just who we are and who we will continue to be.</p>
