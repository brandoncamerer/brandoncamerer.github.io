												<p>LYNCHBURG, Virginia, United States — April 18, 2024 — We are thrilled to announce that we have been named one of the 136 recipients of the 
													2024 Top Virginia Employers for Interns Awards by the Virginia Talent + Opportunity Partnership (V-TOP). This prestigious annual award celebrates 
													Virginia employers who provide high-quality internships to students, and we are honored to be among the recognized organizations.
													</p>
                                                <p>At CloudFit, we understand the importance of offering meaningful internship experiences that not only benefit students and career changers, but also 
													contribute to the growth of our workforce and community in Lynchburg. Through our innovative program, we provide an immersive opportunity for learning, 
													growth, and the development of valuable skills. 
													</p>
                                                <p><h5>From Intern to Full-Time Employee</h5>
													</p>
                                                <p>The impact of our internship program extends beyond the duration of the internship itself. A number of our current employees were once interns who participated in 
													our program and later transitioned to full-time roles within CloudFit. These individuals have gone on to make significant contributions to our team, bringing fresh 
													perspectives, innovative ideas, and valuable skills acquired during their internships.
													</p>
												<p>Here are some testimonials from our current employees reflecting on their internship experience. 
													</p>
												<p><em>Chris Cockes, Service Engineer</em> – “During my Capstone project, I learned how to work as a team to complete a real-world project. Members of our team took turns being the project manager, 
													so we got a lot of leadership experience. We learned how to interact with clients, how to use different technologies, and learned C#. Overall, my experience was extremely positive, our 
													stakeholder was patient, kind, and guided us in the right direction while still being hands off so we learned on our own.”
													</p>
												<p><em>Chris Deaton, Software Development Engineer</em> – “I was a career changer coming in from a dramatically different world than tech. JobFit gave me not only the opportunity, but the knowledge and 
													skills to successfully break into the world of software engineering. In my internship, I was surrounded by encouraging and challenging individuals who took personal stake in seeing me grow 
													into a fellow contributor. It was evident that I wasn’t merely a project but a person. Now, as a full-time employee for CloudFit and coach for JobFit, I enjoy having the same wonderful opportunity 
													to give assistance and training to others in the same way I was given.”
													</p>
												<p><em>Dakota Clark, Command & Control Engineer</em> – “My time at CloudFit has been rather pleasant! The insight I got from taking part in the vulnerability scanning, scripting, and cybersecurity incident response 
													processes will be integral in the future. The amount of focus placed on teamwork, communication, and inclusivity was not something I was expecting from an IT-related organization. Company culture wasn't 
													the only great aspect, I hope I can maintain connections with the fellow interns and employees for years to come.”
													</p>
												<p><em>Jimmy Davila, Service Manager</em> – “I just want to say working as an intern at CloudFit has to have been the greatest experience in my career. Getting to know a plethora of knowledgeable individuals in this career 
													field has given me a leg up on my road to success. The projects they put us on give us real-world experience, which gives us a giant boost in our careers. I would love to work for CloudFit someday not only because 
													of the experiences but because the environment here has been exquisite.”
													</p>
												<p><em>Laurel Melton, Personal Trainer</em> – “I came into the internship at CloudFit from a career in Public Health with a limited background in technology, yet a desire to make a career change and break into the tech space. 
													During my time as an intern, I gained priceless hands-on experience and exposure to IT in a way that ignited a new passion. I received support, mentoring, and encouragement from employees and fellow interns that was 
													crucial in my development - my time here was a major turning point for my career, and I couldn't be more grateful to have been given this opportunity. As a full-time employee for CloudFit, the support I received as an 
													intern has continued and I feel like a valued, appreciated member of a team.”
													</p>
												<p>As we reflect on this achievement, we look forward to continuing to provide exceptional internship opportunities and making a positive impact on the lives of students and the future of our workforce. We're grateful for the 
													partnership with JobFit and the outstanding efforts of our team members, both of which significantly contribute to the program's success.
													</p>
